			<h2>Merry Christmas</h2>
			<p>
				Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily
				on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around
				the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the
				season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which
				historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.[5] Christmas Day
				is a public holiday in many countries,[6][7][8] is celebrated religiously by a majority of
				Christians,[9] as well as culturally by many non-Christians,[1][10] and forms an integral
				part of the holiday season organized around it.

				The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of
				Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies.[11]
				When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a
				stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds
				who then spread the word.[12]
			</p>
			<p>
				There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth
				century, the church fixed the date as December 25.[b][13][14][15] This corresponds to the
				traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar.[16] It is exactly nine months
				after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox.[17] Most Christians
				celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost
				universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of
				the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian
				calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For
				Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins
				of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary
				purpose in celebrating Christmas.[18][19][20]
			</p>

				The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of
				pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins.[21][22] Popular modern customs of
				the holiday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas
				music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church
				services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including
				Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly.
				In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa
				Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and the Christkind, are associated with bringing
				gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and
				lore.[23] Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve
				heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales
				period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a
				steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.
